              <h4>OSURC composite rims</h4>
              <img src="img/p1/p1_1.JPG" width="800" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
            <p>This project involved creating composite rims for the Oregon State University Robotics
               Club's rover. Previous rims for the rover were heavy and lacked rigidity.</p>  

            <p>This was the first project that I was able to work on with OSURC. This project started in Fall of 2020 
              and finished Spring 2022. The beginning stages of this project involved researching composite 
              manufacturing. Global Formula Racing was a massive help during this project. OSURC had lost all composites knoweledge before this proeject began. 
            </p>

            <P>The geometry of the composite rims were deteremined by the infaltable tires being used. Because the rims fit inside of the infaltable tire, 
              we decided to use a female mold to ensure we get accurate exterior geometry. Designing the molds was a long process because of the
              composite material that we selected on using. The prepreg carbon fiber that we selected to use was a Toray T700-2510 prepreg. The 2510 system uses
              a cure temperature of 250-270Â°F so the mold material was crucial. Through an HP sponsorhip, we got molds printed out of PA12 nylon that could withstand
              the high temperatures. 
            </P>

            <p>After learning Siemens NX and Fibersim, we began to experiment with various plys and layups that would be feasible. GFR recomended we use a 0-45-0 layup schedule. 
              The majority of the plys we designed had too many deformations. After many heavily deformed ply designs, it was decided to split the plys into smaller plys. With more 
              smaller plys, we had less deformation, but also a longer layup time. 
            </p>

            <p>The final layup schedule inolved using 12 0Â° and 5 45Â° plys. The plys were cut using a plycutter as seen on the home page of this website. 

            </p>
           
            <div class="grid">
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_2.jpg" width="300" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_3.jpg" width="300" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
            </div>
            

            <p> The plys were placed in the molds and then vacuum bagged. Once vaccum bagged, the molds were placed in the oven for the specified resin curing temperatures and times.

            </p>
            
            <div class="grid">
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_4.jpg" width="350" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_5.jpg" width="350" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
            </div>

            <p>The molds deformed after multiple cycles of laying up and heating. Depite the warped molds, the gemoetry remained close enough such that 
              the rims still fit in the tires.
            </p>

            <div class="grid">
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_6.jpg" width="350" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_7.jpg" width="350" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
            </div>

            <p>Each rim turned out slightly different due to each layup being slightly different. Post processing of the rims was minimal.
              The rims were sanded down to remove any sharp edges, and holes were drilled for attachment to the motor mounts. A 3d printed jig was
              used to get consistent holes.
              
            </p>

            <div class="grid">
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_10.jpg" width="350" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
              <div><img src="img/p1/p1_11.jpg" width="450" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 15px;"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
              The finished rims were then test fit with the tires to ensure fitment. The below two images show the finished assembly.
